<h2 class="lihei1">BAMBOO,<br/>

<span class="fextra2">CONSIDERED AS A MATERIAL FOR PAPER</span></h2>


<h3>REMARKS UPON ITS CULTIVATION AND TREATMENT.</h3>

<p>Of all the fibre-yielding plants known to botanical science there is
not one so well calculated to meet the pressing requirements of the
Paper-trade as "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," both as regards facility and economy
of production, as well as the quality of the "<i>Paper-Stock</i>" which
can be manufactured therefrom: grown under favourable conditions of
climate and soil, there is no plant which will give so heavy a crop of
available fibre to the acre, no plant which requires so little care for
its cultivation and continuous production.</p>

<p>The rapidity of the growth of "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" is unequalled. At
Gehzireh, the gardens of the Khedive of Egypt at Cairo, it has been
known to grow nine inches in a single night. At Syon House, the Duke
of Northumberland's, stems of "<i>Bambusa Gigantea</i>" have attained
the height of 60 feet in 12 weeks; and I have made "<i>Paper-Stock</i>"
from a stem of "<i>Bambusa Vulgaris</i>," sent me by Dr. Hooker, from the
Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, which, as measured by the gardener in
the Palm-house, grew at the rate of three feet in a single week; at
Chatsworth, the Duke of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page4"></a>[p.4]</span> Devonshire's, this same variety (the
"<i>Bambusa Vulgaris</i>") has attained the height of 40 feet in 40 days.</p>

<p>Throughout the East Indies the "Bamboo" flourishes, forming indeed
in many districts impenetrable jungles. It grows abundantly also in
the West Indies, in Central and South America, the Brazils, in Africa
and Asia; in China especially, and in Japan, the plant is indigenous,
and the natives cultivate it carefully, employing it for almost every
article of convenience and luxury; in fact, wherever heat and moisture
exist, some species of the "Bamboo" will be found, or may be readily
cultivated.</p>

<p>Attempts have from time to time been made in England, and elsewhere, to
obtain from the "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" "<i>Half-stuff</i>" or "<i>Pulp</i>" suitable
for the manufacture of paper, and paper indeed has been made therefrom,
but hitherto these attempts have neither industrially nor commercially
attained successful results, and for the following reasons.</p>

<p>Hitherto the "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" has been collected and treated in a
condition more or less of maturity, or without regard to its age;
and when the plant has attained its full growth the woody fibre is
extremely dense and indurated; when old, indeed, the exterior portion
of the stem of many varieties of the plant becomes so hard and
silicious that it will, like flint, strike fire with steel.</p>

<p>Owing to the presence of this large quantity of silica, and the
extreme hardness of the stem when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page5"></a>[p.5]</span> developed and matured, it
has been found by all those who have hitherto experimentally treated
"<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" that the only possible means of converting it into
<i>Pulp</i> for Paper-making, has been to subject it to long-continued
boiling, or digesting, in very strong solutions of caustic alkali, at
an elevated temperature&mdash;in other words, at or under a pressure of ten
to eleven atmospheres (150 to 160 lb. pressure per square inch)&mdash;by
which means a <i>Pulp</i> has certainly been produced, but at a great cost,
and the danger and practical difficulties of working under such high
pressure, have deterred further progress in this direction.</p>

<p>I have found that when the stems of "Bamboo," are cut down at an early
stage of their growth, when the plant is full of sap, and before the
cellulose or cellular tissue, and the lignine have become indurated,
and silica deposited; while, in fact, so to speak, the plant may be
termed a succulent vegetable, and before it has become converted into
wood, that a very mild system of treatment in successive weak alkaline
baths, at atmospheric pressure only, suffices to decompose and render
soluble the mucilaginous and other extractive compounds combined
naturally with the fibrous tissue of the plant, so that they may be
readily eliminated, or separated therefrom, by subsequent washing,
leaving the residuary fibres pure and free.</p>

<p>A comparative illustration of the transitional stage of growth
above referred to, showing the conversion of succulent vegetable
fibrous tissue, into harsh woody <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6"></a>[p.6]</span> fibre, may be remarked with
"Asparagus," the young and green stems of which, are used as a delicacy
for the table, a few weeks further growth converting them into hard
woody fibre, which no amount of boiling would, or could, render
palatable; the "Asparagus," indeed, has its parallel in the "<i>Bambusa
Edulis</i>," a variety of "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," the young stems of which are
eaten and considered very nourishing.</p>

<p>The "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," being an <i>endogenous</i> plant, (that is to say,
growing from inside) composed mainly of fibrous tissue, combined with
the ordinary sappy and other extractive matter common to all vegetable
growth, the stems do not require the elaborate preparatory manipulation
which is necessary to separate the fibrous, from the extraneous and
woody matter, which in <i>exogenous</i> plants (i. e. growing from, or on
the outside) must be removed, as it is only the true fibre which is
useable for Textile Manufactures.</p>

<p>Such plants known to commerce as "<span class="smcap">Flax</span>," "<span class="smcap">Hemp</span>,"
"<span class="smcap">Jute</span>," "<span class="smcap">Rhea</span>," &amp;c. &amp;c., after having become mature,
and being dried, have to undergo a process of retting, or steeping,
followed by scutching and heckling, in order to separate the ultimate
fibres from the woody stem and bark to which, while in their normal
condition, they are attached.</p>

<p>The cost therefore, of producing merchantable fibre from this class
of plants is very considerable, and the produce or yield of fibre,
to the plant cultivated, very small, that of "<span class="smcap">Flax</span>" being
computed at from 5 to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page7"></a>[p.7]</span> 6 cwt., "<span class="smcap">Hemp</span>" 7 cwt., and
"<span class="smcap">Jute</span>" 5 to 6 cwt. per acre, "<span class="smcap">Cotton</span>" being much
less; "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," as I will presently show, producing tons as
compared with cwts. of the foregoing, and, be it noted, with far less
cost for cultivation, and the subsequent preparation of the fibre.</p>

<p>The stems of the "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," cut young, as I propose to
use them, contain from 60 to 75 per cent. of moisture; it will be
obvious, therefore, that to ensure a regular and continuous supply,
under economical conditions, to a central factory for the manufacture
of "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," plantations would have to be formed contiguous
thereto, as practised with "<span class="smcap">Sugar Cane</span>," or in a similar
manner to Osier beds, in England.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the latter, as in order to stimulate a rapid, aqueous,
and sappy growth, as also to provide for the dry seasons common to hot
countries, a system of irrigation would be necessary, such a system
indeed being at present practised with the <span class="smcap">Sugar Cane</span>, in
Egypt, Spain, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>With plantations of "Sugar Cane," to which plant the "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>"
somewhat assimilates in character and growth, it is necessary, in order
to ripen the canes and develop saccharine, to allow free ventilation to
the growing plant, and thus the ground is not fully occupied; this would
not be the case with "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," which should be planted and grown
closely together to favour the stems shooting upwards, as practised
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8"></a>[p.8]</span> with "<span class="smcap">Hemp</span>" and "<span class="smcap">Flax</span>," where fine staple of fibre
is desired.</p>

<p>By following such a system, the stools or roots once established, a
systematical and regular cropping, or cutting, would ensue, the stems
being all cut down simultaneously, by sections or beds, in regular
succession, numerous croppings annually would thus be obtained, and
when necessary, fresh beds would be formed, the older growth being
available for fuel for the manufactory.</p>

<p>The Sugar Cane from the time of planting, to cutting, takes from nine
to twelve months to grow and mature; but even thus grown, the produce
of canes (ready dressed for the mill) generally ranges from 30 to
35 tons to the acre, it sometimes exceeds 40 tons; allowing several
crops or cuttings annually for the "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," it may fairly be
assumed that at least this latter quantity would be obtained per acre.</p>

<p>Allowing 208 feet square to represent one acre; divided into twelve
beds, each 96 × 26 feet, with twelve paths 96´ × 8´ 8´´ wide, and one
intersecting road 208 × 16 feet wide, leaves a space for planting equal
to 2496 feet, or 29,952 feet in the twelve beds; allowing the stems to
be 2 feet apart, and say only 12 feet high, we have 7488 stems, which
at 12 lb. each = 40 tons per acre.</p>

<p>The stem of the "<i>Bambusa Vulgaris</i>" before mentioned, grown in
the Palm-house at Kew, was of an average size, 10 to 11 inches
circumference, and weighed green 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lb. per foot run; and although
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9"></a>[p.9]</span> no doubt by denser growth, induced by frequent cropping, the
stems even of the larger varieties of "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" would decrease
in size, still an equal tonnage to the acre would be produced, with
longer joints or internodes, and a finer staple of fibre.</p>

<p>The stems of the "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" (<i>taken as dry</i>) treated by
my process, will yield 60 per cent. of unbleached <i>Fibrous</i>
"<i>Paper-Stock</i>," baled up in merchantable condition; assuming therefore
an annual cropping of 40 tons, green stems, which will lose 75 per
cent. moisture in drying, we have 10 tons dry stems per acre; these at
60 per cent. yield, will give 6 tons per acre of "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," an
enormous product as compared with any other fibrous material with which
I am acquainted.</p>

<p>Allowing the plantation to be credited at the rate of 5<i>s.</i> per ton,
for the green stems, delivered to the central factory, and 40 tons to
be produced per acre, we have the sum of 10<i>l.</i> per acre to cover all
charges; once, however, the plantation formed, but little cost in the
way of cultivation need be incurred. The main outlay would be for rent,
irrigation, and cutting, and carrying to the manufactory.</p>

<p>I may here remark that I propose where possible, to return to the
<i>Plantation</i>, mixed with the water employed for irrigation, the
mucilaginous and other extractive constituents, or matters, (amounting
to 40 per cent.) abstracted from the stems during the process of
manufacturing the "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," as Manure, thus maintaining
fertilization to the growing plant.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10"></a>[p.10]</span> <span class="smcap">Details of my System of Treating "Bamboo" for the
Manufacture of Fibrous</span> "<i>Paper-Stock</i>."</h3>

<p>An essential point in my system for treating "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" to
produce therefrom fibrous "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," consists in operating upon
the stems of the plant when young, and preferably when fresh, as, and
when, cut and collected.</p>

<p>Brought therefore to a central factory in this condition, the stems
are passed through heavy crushing rolls, in order to split and flatten
them, and at the same time crush, or smash, the knots, or nodes. The
stems thus flattened, are then passed through a second series of
rolls, which are channelled, or grooved, in order further to split, or
partially divide them longitudinally into strips, or ribbons; these
being cut transversely, into convenient lengths by a guillotine knife
or shears, are delivered by a carrier, or automatic feeder, direct to
the boiling pans, or elsewhere, as desired.</p>

<p>As the stems when fresh and green, contain from 60 to 75 per cent.
of sappy and mucilaginous matter, much of this is expressed by the
crushing, while at the same time the fibrous mass, being partially
disintegrated, is thus more readily acted upon in the succeeding
processes.</p>

<p>If desired, the crushed stems may be dried and stored; such drying,
however, must be very carefully <span class="pagenum"><a id="page11"></a>[p.11]</span> conducted and watched to avoid
destructive fermentation.</p>

<p>I have in the preceding "Remarks" referred to "<span class="smcap">Flax</span>,"
"<span class="smcap">Hemp</span>," "<span class="smcap">Jute</span>," and similar <span class="smcap">Fibres</span> known
to commerce, such fibres being imported into this country in their
prepared condition, suitable for Textile purposes. They have, in fact,
passed through a process of semi-manufacture, such process, as I have
explained, being required to separate the ultimate fibres from the
interior woody stem to which when growing they are attached; and it is
obvious that it would not be (economically) possible to import any of
these fibrous plants as grown or produced, owing to their enormous bulk
in that condition.</p>

<p>Now although the stems of the "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," after cutting and
crushing, may, as I have shown, be dried (and will when dried give
a yield of 60 per cent. of fibre), still their bulk and extreme
lightness would preclude importing them to this country in their <i>raw</i>
condition, not merely from their heavy cost for carriage, but from
their liability to damage from fermentation. For these economical
considerations, therefore, I propose to reduce the "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>"
into "<i>Fibrous-Stock</i>" where grown or produced.</p>

<p>It may be well, before entering into details of the process, briefly to
explain the ordinary system employed for preparing fibres, or fibrous
materials, as also rags, for Paper-making. This consists in sorting,
cutting, cleaning, and, if need be, roughly opening them, followed by
boiling in alkaline leys, after which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page12"></a>[p.12]</span> they are well washed
until cleansed from impurities in what is technically termed the rag
or breaker engine, during which operation they are disintegrated or
reduced into "<i>Half-stuff</i>," or <i>semi-pulp</i>, this being subsequently
bleached and converted into pulp and paper.</p>

<p>As the object of my process is to produce a fibrous or tow-like
<i>Stock</i>, retaining as far as possible the normal or natural condition
of the fibre, and not "<i>Half-stuff</i>" or "<i>Pulp</i>," my system of
treatment differs materially from the foregoing, more especially in the
boiling and washing processes.</p>

<p>Both of these processes I conduct in a battery, or series of vessels
(16, 20, or more in number), such vessels being connected together
by pipes, or channels, furnished with valves, or cocks, so that
communication between the individual vessels may be maintained,
disconnected, and regulated as desired, in such manner that the
vessels, being methodically charged in succession with the material to
be operated upon, the heated leys (composed of caustic alkali) can be
progressively conducted from vessel to vessel of the series, passing
over and through the material placed therein.</p>

<p>The leys are thus used again and again, (each successive change, or
charge of ley, carrying forward the extractive matters it has dissolved
from the fibre with which it has been in contact) until exhausted or
neutralized, (when they are discharged), fresh leys being methodically,
and successively, supplied, until by degrees, the extractive matters
combined with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13"></a>[p.13]</span> the fibre or fibrous material have been
rendered sufficiently soluble, when hot water for washing, or rinsing,
is in the same continuous manner run successively from vessel to
vessel, over, and through, the material contained therein, until the
extractive matters rendered soluble by the previous alkaline baths
have been carried forward and discharged, leaving the residuary fibre
sufficiently cleansed.</p>

<p>By this system of boiling in continuity, until all the effective
alkali in the leys is exhausted or neutralized, I realize an economy
of from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. of soda over the ordinary process
of boiling, and by the subsequent washing, or rinsing, in the same
continuous manner, without removing the material from the vessels, the
normal structure of the fibre is in a great measure retained, waste is
minimized, and thus, while being thoroughly cleansed and freed from
extraneous matter, the strength and staple of the fibre are preserved;
a considerable saving of fuel results from the heated liquors being
used again and again, less steam being required, as also less water,
while at the same time economy of both labour and power is effected
over the ordinary system.</p>

<p>Assuming the boiling and succeeding washing processes to be concluded,
and the material ("<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>") in one of the vessels of the
series in its regular succession, to be found sufficiently treated and
cleansed, a final cooling water is run on and through the fibre, which
is then drained, and the contents of the vessel (disconnected for the
time being from the series) <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14"></a>[p.14]</span> emptied into a waggon running on a
railway, by which it is conducted to a press or otherwise to abstract
all the remaining moisture possible.</p>

<p>The dry, or semi-dry fibre, is then submitted to the action of a
willow, or devil, by means of which it is opened or teazed out, and
converted readily into a tow-like condition, when it is dried by a
current of heated air, induced by a fan-blast, and finally baled up
for storage or transport, in a similar manner to <span class="smcap">Cotton</span> or
<span class="smcap">Jute</span>.</p>

<p>In this condition of "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," it may be kept an indefinite
length of time without injury, and when received by the
Paper-manufacturer requires merely soaking down and bleaching, to fit
it for making into paper, either by itself, or used as a blend with
other materials, as desired.</p>

<p>The minuter details of my process for treating raw fibres, or fibrous
material, for the manufacture therefrom of <i>Fibrous</i> "<i>Paper-Stock</i>,"
are fully described in my several Patents, the only variation so far
as relates to "Bamboo" being the preliminary preparation of the young
stems, the other portions of the process being substantially the same
as in daily operation at the Ford Works, Sunderland, for the treatment
of "Esparto," and other "<i>raw fibres</i>."</p>

<p>I have only now further to remark that the "Plant" required to
manufacture "<i>Paper-Stock</i>" from "Bamboo" on an economical and
practical working scale, would consist of a battery of boiling pans,
with the other necessary adjuncts and machinery, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15"></a>[p.15]</span> steam engines
and steam boilers, such "Plant" being on a scale adequate to the
manufacture of 100 tons "Bamboo" weekly, producing therefrom say 60
tons merchantable "<i>Paper-Stock</i>."</p>

<p>As the above scale of operations, viz. the Manufacture of 100 tons
("<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>") weekly into "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," may appear somewhat
large, it is necessary I should explain that owing to the nature of
the Process, the desired effect being produced by the reiterated
and continuous action of repeated <i>weak</i> Alkaline Baths or Leys, in
a Series of Vessels, such an operation involves the treatment of a
large quantity of "<i>Raw Material</i>," at one time, and cannot either
conveniently or economically be conducted upon a much smaller scale.</p>

<p>The cost of the "Plant" and Machinery required for such a Factory
would amount to about ***, packed ready for shipment in England, to
which would have to be added the carriage and cost of erection, with
the necessary buildings, which, however, would be of a very simple and
inexpensive character.</p>

<p>I do not feel myself competent to determine what quantity of Land
would be required for a plantation to supply such a factory, which
would absorb 100 tons dry, say 400 tons green, "Bamboo" stems weekly,
but assuming 40 tons produce to the acre, with only once annual
cropping, 500 acres should be ample. This calculation doubtless would
be influenced by the varying conditions of climate and soil, as also by
the variety of "Bamboo" cultivated.</p>

<p>It may be expected that I should in these "<span class="smcap">Remarks</span>" <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16"></a>[p.16]</span>
include some reference to the "<i>Variety</i>" of "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" which
could be most economically and profitably cultivated for the supply of
such a Factory, on the scale I propose.</p>

<p>In respect to this portion of my subject I experience some difficulty,
inasmuch as the <i>Varieties</i> of "Bamboo" are so numerous, and so widely
distributed.</p>

<p>A Monograph by Colonel (now General) Munro, C.B., published in the
'Transactions of the Linnean Society,' affords the most elaborate and
comprehensive description of the "Bamboo:" in this paper upwards of 170
species are described.</p>

<p>The "<i>Bambusa Vulgaris</i>," as its name indeed denotes, appears to be the
most generally distributed, as it is found in both Hemispheres, General
Munro being in considerable doubt as to which it is a native of.</p>

<p>I quote from his Monograph: "I have seen it collected by Wallich, in
Silhet, by Hooker, in Chittagong (both North-east India), from Ceylon
wild, in the Mauritius cultivated abundantly, in the West Indies
naturalized, and cultivated in several parts of South America, this is
the only thoroughly cosmopolitan species."</p>

<p>Bambusa "<i>Gigantea</i>," growing to the height of 120 feet and from
25 to 30 inches circumference; B. "<i>Edulis</i>," or edible Bamboo; B.
"<i>Arundinacea</i>;" B. "<i>Balcooa</i>;" B. "<i>Brandisii</i>," &amp;c., all varying in
growth to from 60 to 70, to 120 feet high, abound throughout India, and
all our Asiatic Dependencies. In the West <span class="pagenum"><a id="page17"></a>[p.17]</span> Indies also, where
not now indigenous, doubtless any variety selected could readily be
introduced and cultivated.</p>

<p>To conclude, it would appear that with the "<i>Raw Material</i>" "Bamboo,"
we have under our control "an embarrassment of riches," and I have only
further to add that I know of no other that can at all approach it in
economy of production, and I believe very few if any in the quality of
the "<i>Stock</i>" produced therefrom suitable for Paper-making purposes.</p>

<span class="fextra2">CONSIDERED AS A PAPER-MAKING MATERIAL.</span></h2>


<h3>THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE PAPER TRADE IN RELATION TO THE SUPPLY OF
RAW MATERIAL.</h3>

<p>"The deficient supply of, and the increasing price for, the materials
for making paper and the prospect of a still greater consumption has
for some time excited the attention of manufacturers and the public."</p>

<p>The above <span class="smcap">Remarks</span> prefacing a <span class="smcap">Memorandum</span> drawn up by
Dr. Forbes Royle, reporting for "<span class="smcap">The Commissioners for the Affairs
of India</span>," at the desire of "<span class="smcap">The Lords of Her Majesty's
Treasury</span>," and of "<span class="smcap">The Lords of the Committee of the Privy
Council for Trade</span>," in 1854, and subsequently published in his
valuable work, "<span class="smcap">The Fibrous Plants of India</span>," in 1855&mdash;twenty
years ago&mdash;truly represent the position of the Paper-Trade at the
present time.</p>

<p>The extension of education and literature, the necessity for cheap
newspapers and serial publications, the increased demand for paper for
writing, as also for manufacturing and commercial purposes generally,
have greatly stimulated consumption, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page19"></a>[p.19]</span> it is believed that
since the abolition of the Excise duty in 1861, the annual production
of paper has more than doubled.</p>

<p>Previous to 1861, raw fibrous material, with the exception perhaps of
Straw, was but little used in paper-making, the waste of cotton, flax,
hemp, and jute mills, having undergone a process of semi-manufacture,
being comprised under the generic term of&mdash;Rags.</p>

<p>The American war, immediately following the repeal of the paper duty,
threatening a cotton famine, the Paper-makers gladly availed themselves
of a new material, "Esparto," which I had for some time previously been
ineffectually endeavouring to introduce, and adopting my process for
its treatment, this material entered speedily into consumption, and
has tended more than anything else to promote the development of the
Paper-trade by enabling the manufacturers to keep pace with the rapidly
increasing demand.</p>

<p>The importations of "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>," which did not amount to
1000 tons in the year 1860 (indeed up to that date I was the only
manufacturer using it<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>), rose to upwards of 50,000 tons in the year
1865, and by 1871&mdash;ten years only from its introduction&mdash;the annual
imports had attained the large total of 140,000 tons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page20"></a>[p.20]</span> "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>" being a wild grass (or, botanically
speaking, a sedge) growing on waste lands, in Spain and Africa, owing
to the greed of the native collectors&mdash;who, while gathering the plant,
pluck it up recklessly, roots and all&mdash;is being gradually but surely
exterminated.</p>

<p>The complete exhaustion of the plant is proceeding very rapidly in
Spain; and as it is estimated by the best informed authorities that it
will take, even with the greatest care and under the most favourable
conditions, at least fifteen years to reproduce it from seed (a system
not very likely to be pursued in that country,) at no very remote
period this valuable paper-making material appears doomed to extinction.</p>

<p>During the last few years a large and increasing supply of
"<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>," or as it is there called "<i>Alfa</i>," has been
received from Africa; and although the quality of African Esparto is
not valued by the paper-trade as high as the Spanish, still it meets
with a ready sale, being used to mix with, or in substitution of the
latter.</p>

<p>As much as 60,000 tons were imported last year (1874) from Algeria,
and great inducements by concessions and otherwise, are offered by the
French Government to induce railway communication with the interior
districts of that country, where the plant is said to abound on some
of the mountainous plateaux, and thus for some little time the market
may be supplied, but the difficulty of procuring labour, and the
cost of railway carriage for such long distances, will <span class="pagenum"><a id="page21"></a>[p.21]</span> add
considerably to the present charges of transit to this country.</p>

<p>Within the last two or three years, the Belgian and American
Paper-makers have commenced using "Esparto," and so latterly have the
French, and as our main sources of supply will now be Algeria, (a
French colony,) any material reduction in prices can hardly be looked
for.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>," like other commercial products, is amenable to
the law of supply and demand; and thus, as the demand is, and is
likely to continue in excess of the supply, its cost has enormously
increased, the price it now commands in the market being nearly double
that, at which I sold many thousand tons during the early years of its
introduction.</p>

<p>The Paper-manufacturers are thus again experiencing the same difficulty
recognized by <span class="smcap">The Lords of the Treasury</span>, and by <span class="smcap">The Board of
Trade</span> in 1854, and which more recently was considered of sufficient
importance to induce the appointment of a <span class="smcap">Select Committee</span>
ordered by <span class="smcap">The House of Commons</span> in 1861:</p>

<p>"To inquire into the <span class="smcap">Duties or Prohibitions</span> in <span class="smcap">Foreign
Countries</span> on the <span class="smcap">Export of Rags</span> used in the
<span class="smcap">Manufacture of Paper</span> in the <span class="smcap">United Kingdom</span>, and their
effect upon that <span class="smcap">Manufacture</span>."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Committee reported</span>: "That the production of paper in
this country is in excess of the supply of the material of which it
is made, and the paper manufacture is in consequence dependent for a
large portion of its supplies on foreign Rags, amounting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page22"></a>[p.22]</span> to
about 15,000 tons per annum, which is by estimation a fifth of the
whole quantity of Rags used for the manufacture of white paper in this
country, on nearly the whole of which heavy export duties are paid."</p>

<p>Another paragraph of the <span class="smcap">Committee's "Report"</span> states: "That
the Committee have directed their especial attention to inquiring as
to the possibility of applying any <i>New Fibre</i> as a substitute for the
refuse material now in use for Paper-making purposes, and find that
great efforts have been made to discover some material of this nature,
but as yet with little success; and although they see no reason to
doubt that Straw and other fibrous substances may form a supplementary
part of the material for paper-making, the great comparative expense of
chemically reducing these <i>Raw Fibres</i> presents difficulties to their
becoming a substitute for the refuse material now used."</p>

<p>Since the above "<span class="smcap">Report</span>" was published, the position of the
Trade has materially altered. The export duties in some countries
have been abolished, in others reduced; Rag material has increased
in quantity and diminished in price; "the difficulties of chemically
reducing <i>Raw Fibres</i>" no longer exist; and the "15,000 <i>tons</i> of
Rags" estimated by the "<span class="smcap">Committee</span>" as the requirements of
the Trade have been more than "substituted" by the 150,000 <i>tons of</i>
"<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>" <i>and other Raw material</i>, now annually imported,
while the development of the chemical trade keeping pace with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page23"></a>[p.23]</span>
the introduction of "<span class="smcap">Raw Fibres</span>" has materially facilitated
their employment.</p>

<p>Caustic soda, but little known in 1861, is now extensively
manufactured, and Weldon's new process has greatly increased the power
of production and diminished the cost of manufacturing bleaching
powder; thus "the comparative expense of chemically reducing <i>Raw
Fibres</i>" is no longer an obstacle to progress.</p>

<p>The manufacturer of the present day will, in fact, undertake to make
paper from any raw fibre, or fibrous substance that may be submitted to
him.</p>

<p>He has, however, several questions to consider before he will commit
himself to purchase or contract for any new fibrous material, these
being: its cost, not merely as a raw material, but in the details
of manufacture, and the quality of the paper that can economically
be made from such fibre, either alone, or introducing it as a blend
with the material he at present employs; then, assuming these points
satisfactorily determined, he would desire to know the quantity of such
material annually available, with some guarantee for continuous and
reliable supply at a price not liable to erratic fluctuations.</p>

<p>The value of "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>" as a Paper-making material having
been recognized, and its employment almost universally adopted in the
Trade, naturally led to various attempts to introduce other "<i>new
material</i>," which hitherto, however, have met with only partial
success: the "<span class="smcap">Dwarf Palm</span>," <i>Cham&oelig;rops humilis</i>, and
"<span class="smcap">Diss</span>," <span class="pagenum"><a id="page24"></a>[p.24]</span> as well as some other materials from North
Africa, have been tried and abandoned as unsuitable: "<span class="smcap">Jute</span>"
also has latterly attracted considerable attention; "Butts" or
"Cuttings," as they are termed, the refuse from the preparation of
the long clean fibre now so largely used as a Textile, have entered
extensively into consumption, being imported from India specially for
paper-makers' use, packed in hydraulic-pressed bales; but this fibre
is difficult and costly to bleach perfectly, and is only employed
for the lower class of "News" and "Common printing," or unbleached,
for "Brown" and "Wrapping" papers; but as it has long been familiar
to the trade in the form of Waste, Gunny-bagging, and Rope, it can
hardly be termed a "<i>New Material</i>."</p>

<p>Two or three other excellent fibrous materials may be mentioned,
small parcels of which are occasionally to be met with, that are, or
more correctly speaking would be, much prized by Paper-manufacturers
if obtainable at reasonable rates, such as "<span class="smcap">Adansonia Bark</span>,"
"<span class="smcap">New Zealand Flax</span>," "<span class="smcap">Manilla Hemp</span>," "<span class="smcap">Sunn</span>," and other <span class="smcap">Indian, Hemp-like
Fibres</span>, all of which will bleach well and make paper of superior quality;
but unfortunately the quantity available is so small, and the supply so
irregular and uncertain, that they can hardly be relied upon as "<i>Raw
Material</i>."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Wood</span>," both chemically and mechanically prepared, has been,
and indeed is now, used to a very considerable extent; but the latter,
produced by grinding down "billets" from the tree as cut down, on a
grindstone to a pulp, with water, or without water, to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page25"></a>[p.25]</span>
condition of flour, contains but little fibre, and that fibre with very
little "felting" property (an essential for a good sheet of paper);
thus it can only be used as a "filler-up" for "cheap News" and common
papers, like "clay" (facetiously called in the trade Devonshire linen),
or any other adulterant which the necessities of the Paper-maker, to
meet the market, (<i>or in other words deficient supply of good and cheap
suitable material</i>) compel him to use.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Wood</span>," chemically prepared, is costly in production, as it
is only possible to reduce it into <i>Pulp</i>, by boiling under very high
pressure, with strong caustic alkali; several mills established both
in England and Scotland, to carry out this manufacture, have abandoned
it, and such <i>Pulp</i> as is now used in the Trade is derived exclusively
from the countries where the wood is grown. The <i>Pulp</i> thus produced,
although somewhat hard and harsh, if the wood is carefully selected,
and properly prepared, will, blended with other material, produce a
fair quality of paper.</p>

<p>The use of "<span class="smcap">Straw</span>," from the "<i>Cereals</i>," <span class="smcap">Wheat</span>,
<span class="smcap">Oats</span>, and <span class="smcap">Rye</span>, has of late years greatly extended,
both in this country and throughout the continent of Europe, as well
as in the United States of America, either alone or as an admixture
with rags and other material, for all classes of paper, as these
countries equally with England suffer from a deficient supply of <i>Raw
Material</i>; but in England, owing to the increased consumption for
agricultural and feeding purposes, and influenced also by the scarcity
and high prices lately ruling for "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>" in many districts,
"<span class="smcap">Straw</span>" <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26"></a>[p.26]</span> has become very difficult to obtain, and
considerable quantities have in consequence been imported from Holland
and Belgium, both raw, and as bleached <i>Pulp</i>.</p>

<p>I may here mention two other fibrous substances, which have from time
to time attracted considerable attention, viz. "<span class="smcap">Maize Leaves</span>"
and "<span class="smcap">Rice Straw</span>," both of them <i>raw materials</i>, from which
a fair quality of paper is produced in the countries where these
plants are cultivated; but, as in their natural condition after being
harvested they are far too bulky to permit of transport to this
country, they would have to be reduced to a portable form where they
grow, and even then, owing to the small yield of "<i>true fibre</i>," their
economical conversion is somewhat doubtful, unless under favourable
conditions.</p>

<p>The daily increasing demand for <span class="smcap">Paper</span> being recognized, and
the impending if not immediate scarcity of <i>Raw Material</i> available for
its manufacture, up to the present time, having been shown, to what
quarter must the Trade look for an extended supply?</p>

<p>This it must be admitted has become an important question for
consideration, it being evident that unless some "<i>New Material</i>"
suitable for the purpose is speedily introduced, the "<span class="smcap">Paper
Trade</span>," one of the most important in the <span class="smcap">United Kingdom</span>,
will be seriously crippled; meanwhile of necessity high prices are
maintained, and as a natural consequence the consumer suffers.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page27"></a>[p.27]</span> <span class="smcap">Fibre-producing Plants&mdash;Sources of Supply.</span></h3>

<p>The high value of land precludes the cultivation of any fibrous material
exclusively for paper-making in England, even if this climate was
suitable for its growth; with the exception indeed of "<span class="smcap">Flax</span>"
and "<span class="smcap">Hemp</span>," it would appear that northern latitudes are not
favourable for the production of fibre-producing plants, and therefore it
is to warm or <i>tropical countries</i> alone any reliable supply of "<span class="smcap">New
Material</span>" can be looked for.</p>

<p>In the <i>East</i>, and <i>West Indies</i>, in her <i>Colonies</i> and <i>Dependencies</i>,
England possesses an inexhaustible supply of fibre-producing plants; in
India especially, almost every plant abounds more or less in fibre.</p>

<p>In China and Japan, as also in India, from the earliest times, paper
has been made exclusively from <i>raw indigenous virgin fibres</i>, and the
paper produced in these countries is in consequence generally extremely
strong and tough, and although unbleached, and not made in a fashion
adapted to European requirements, affords ample and conclusive evidence
of the valuable supply of material at our disposal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetable Fibrous</span>, or <span class="smcap">Fibre-producing Plants</span>, are
divided by <span class="smcap">Botanists</span> into two distinct <span class="smcap">Classes</span>
or <span class="smcap">Divisions</span>: <span class="smcap">Endogens</span>, or inside growers;
<span class="smcap">Exogens</span>, or outside growers.</p>

<p>From the former are obtained the fibres known as "<span class="smcap">Manilla Hemp</span>"
or "<span class="smcap">Abaca</span>" (from the <i>Musa textilis</i> or <i>Plantain</i>), the
"<span class="smcap">Aloe</span>," "<span class="smcap">Agavé</span>" (or "<i>Pita</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page28"></a>[p.28]</span> <i>Fibre</i>"), the
"<span class="smcap">Yucca</span>," "<span class="smcap">Bromelia penguin</span>," "<span class="smcap">Sisal Hemp</span>" (or <i>Hannequin</i>);
"<span class="smcap">Pina Fibre</span>" from the "<span class="smcap">Pine Apple</span>" (<i>Ananassa sativa</i>), "<span class="smcap">Marool</span>
or <span class="smcap">Moorva</span>" (<i>Sanseveira Zeylanica</i>), "<span class="smcap">New Zealand Flax</span>" (<i>Phormium
tenax</i>), &amp;c.; "<span class="smcap">Maize</span>" (or <i>Indian Corn</i>), "<span class="smcap">Rice</span>," and other
"<span class="smcap">Cereal Straws</span>," "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>," "<span class="smcap">Diss</span>," and various "Sedges,"
"Reeds," and "Grasses," the latter including "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," and "<span class="smcap">Sugar Cane</span>,"
are also comprised in this Class.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fibres</span>, or <span class="smcap">Fibrous Tissue</span> enveloping the <i>Stems</i>
of <i>Herbaceous Plants</i>, known as "<span class="smcap">Hemp</span>," "<span class="smcap">Flax</span>," "<span class="smcap">Jute</span>," "<span class="smcap">Hibiscus</span>,"
(<i>Gombo</i> or <i>Okhro</i>), "<span class="smcap">Rhea</span>," or "<span class="smcap">China-Grass</span>" (<i>Urtica nivea</i>), "<span class="smcap">Sunn
Hemp</span>" (<i>Cratolaria juncea</i>), &amp;c., as also the <span class="smcap">Lace Barks</span> (so
called), such as the "<span class="smcap">Adansonia digitatas</span>" (from the <i>Baobab</i>
tree), the "<span class="smcap">Nepal Paper Plant</span>" (<i>Daphne cannabina</i>), the
"<span class="smcap">Paper Mulberry</span>" (<i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i>), &amp;c., constitute the
latter Class.</p>

<p>I have confined myself to recapitulating <i>a few only</i> of the <i>fibres</i>
in either class, best known to commerce; this list, indeed, might
be extended almost indefinitely, as may be seen by reference to the
work before alluded to, 'The Fibrous Plants of India,' by Dr. Forbes
Royle, as also to the elaborate Paper on the same subject, read at the
meeting of the Society of Arts, May 9, 1860, by Dr. J. Forbes Watson,
Reporter on the Products of India, Dr. Royle's able successor.</p>

<p>With some few exceptions (notably "Esparto" and some of the Cereal
straws and grasses), the resulting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page29"></a>[p.29]</span> or ultimate fibres from
vegetable fibrous plants, before they can be utilized either for
Textile purposes, or for the manufacture of Paper, must be freed from
the extraneous substances with which during their growth they are more
or less combined.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>Endogens</i>, the fibres are imbedded or enveloped in
succulent, fleshy, or pulpy stems, or leaves; and in the case of
<i>Exogens</i>, the fibre is combined with, and attaching to, wood, or woody
matter, such extraneous substances or matters constituting, more or
less, a considerable portion both of the weight and bulk of the plant
even when matured.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Treatment of Fibre-producing Plants.</span></h3>

<p>From all, or nearly all, <i>Endogenous</i> plants the fibres are extracted
by hand labour, no machinery having been hitherto invented by which
this operation can be performed in an economical and satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>The fleshy stems, or leaves, of this class of plants are crushed and
beaten, macerated in water, scraped and roughly combed, to separate the
fibrous from the vascular, or pulpy portion of the plant; sometimes
the plants are buried in wet sand, or mud, leaving them to soak, or
rot, for many days, then beaten on a stone, scraped, and combed; but by
this system the fibres generally lose colour and strength. The yield of
fibre from this class of <i>Endogens</i> ranges from 6 to 12 per cent., and
it is only where native labour is exceedingly cheap and abundant that
such a laborious and tedious process could be carried on.</p>

<p>The majority of the fibres from <i>Exogenous</i> plants <span class="pagenum"><a id="page30"></a>[p.30]</span> are also,
in somewhat a similar manner obtained solely by manual labour; the
herbaceous, or woody stems of such plants, being first steeped, or
retted, to induce partial fermentation, and facilitate the separation
of the corticular fibres, from the woody stem.</p>

<p>When produced in Europe, Flax and Hemp form an exception, being
generally dried before steeping, which process is also more
systematically and regularly conducted, and the subsequent separation
of the ultimate fibres effected by breaking, scutching, and heckling;
these operations being as far as possible carried out mechanically.</p>

<p>When the cost of cultivation, of carriage, freight to this country,
charges and merchants' profit, are added to the outlay involved
in producing clean fibres by the laborious and tedious processes
described, even with the exceedingly cheap labour of <i>tropical
countries</i>, it will readily be understood that they cannot be sold at a
cheap rate.</p>

<p>When the above outlay has been incurred, and clean merchantable fibre
results, such fibre will generally secure a high price in the market
for Spinning, Roping, and other Textile purposes, far beyond the
Paper-maker's limits, who therefore can only avail himself of damaged
parcels, or such as, being of low or inferior quality, have been
rejected by the "Spinner," and, even then, has to come into competition
with the maker of low-class goods, the common "sacking and mat-maker,"
as any fibre of fair strength, long enough to spin into a coarse yarn,
commands good value in the market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page31"></a>[p.31]</span> It will be obvious from the preceding remarks that the
Paper-manufacturer, for an extended supply of <i>Material</i>, must look
to a <i>fibre</i> or fibrous substance which, either like "Esparto," can
be utilized direct, without having to pass through this process of
semi-manufacture, or to some other "<i>New Material</i>," which, from the
peculiarity either of its production or growth, and to the simplicity
and economy of its treatment, can be imported into this country, in a
condition suitable for his requirements.</p>

<p>Knowing from personal observation the peculiarities of the growth,
production, and collection of the "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>" plant, and believing
the time would come when the supply would be unequal to the demand
(although I must admit, owing to the rapid extension of the Paper-trade,
that time has arrived sooner than I anticipated), I have long and
continuously kept my attention directed to any "<i>New Material</i>" which
appeared likely to become available for Paper-making purposes.</p>

<p>For many years past, I have devoted much time to the investigation of
<i>Fibres</i>, during which period I have, I believe, tested both chemically
and practically as a Paper-maker, nearly every <i>fibrous material</i>
introduced into the market, with, as may naturally be supposed,
extremely variable results.</p>

<p>Before any "<i>New Material</i>" will be favourably received by the
Paper-manufacturer, it is clear that certain conditions must be
fulfilled; these being that such "<i>Material</i>" shall favourably compare,
so far as regards quality and cost, with those he now employs, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page32"></a>[p.32]</span>
and that he shall feel satisfied he may rely upon a continuity of
supply, not subject to violent fluctuations in price.</p>

<p>Once assured on these points, there can be no doubt that, especially
under existing circumstances (viz. deficient supply and high prices),
the Paper-trade would gladly welcome the advent of any "<i>New Material</i>"
calculated to relieve the present, or apprehended scarcity.</p>


<h3>NEW MATERIALS.</h3>

<p>Fortunately for the Paper-trade, and its supply of materials in the
future, two <i>raw fibrous substances</i> exist, to which I now desire
to direct special attention, as I believe it would be difficult, if
not impossible, to meet with any others to compare with them in the
essential points, of reliable supply at extremely low cost combined
with quality.</p>

<p>With this conviction I have devoted much attention to perfecting a
simple and economical system of treating them, in order to produce a
fibrous "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," considering <i>that</i> to be the most practicable
and best form in which they can be introduced into the Market.</p>

<p>One of these materials, "<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>," or "<span class="smcap">Begasse</span>,"
fulfils the main conditions which would be looked for by the
Paper-manufacturer, inasmuch as vast quantities are available at a
low cost, and owing to the peculiarity of its production being the
necessary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page33"></a>[p.33]</span> by-product of a large and widely spread staple
industry&mdash;Sugar&mdash;not subject to the ordinary irregularity of supply.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>," the fibrous residue of the Sugar-Cane (after it
has been crushed to extract the juice), properly prepared, affords
a strong, nervous fibre, or "<i>Fibrous Stock</i>," which bleaches well,
and possesses all the characteristics of a first-class Paper-making
material.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>" however, as it comes from the crushing rolls,
and even when dried after crushing, is so exceedingly bulky, that
(being produced almost exclusively in tropical countries) the cost of
carriage added to its great liability to damage from fermentation,
precludes the possibility of its being imported to England in its
crude state; moreover, the true fibrous portion of "Megasse" does not
amount to more than 40 per cent., the remainder being constituted of
<span class="smcap">Cellulose</span>, combined with glutenous and other compounds, which
of themselves are useless for Paper-making, and which consequently must
be separated from the residuary or ultimate fibre.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that "<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>" must be converted into
a <i>Fibrous Stock</i> at, or near, the Sugar factory where it is produced,
then dried, and put up in hydraulic-pressed bales for economical
transport.</p>

<p>The present value of "<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>" (in its crude condition as
produced) is relatively to that of fuel, as, unless it is returned to
the soil as manure (which is the practice in some countries), it is
employed in the Sugar factories, for raising steam, for motive power,
and for evaporating the Cane juice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page34"></a>[p.34]</span> As the value of "Megasse" thus considered is very low,
factories established in connection with existing sugar mills for the
manufacture of "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," where sufficient quantities of so bulky
a material could be concentrated, and where other favourable conditions
exist (of which an abundant supply of water is an essential), would
yield a large profit to the planter or sugar manufacturer, as the
"<i>Paper-Stock</i>" he would produce would meet with a ready sale at
prices at least equivalent to "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>," reduced to the same
condition.</p>

<p>Having made "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," and "<i>Paper</i>" of good quality from
"<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>," and determined the profitable result of such a
manufacture beyond dispute, I look forward at no very distant date to
see the Paper-trade of this country receiving, at least, a portion of
its <i>raw material</i> from some of our own <i>Colonies</i> and <i>Dependencies</i>
(in most of which Sugar is produced), instead of, as now, being
entirely dependent on Foreign Countries for supply.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the consumption of sugar in England amounts
annually to upwards of 800,000 tons, or about 57 lb. per head of the
population; and as it may be assumed that for each ton of sugar 1 ton
of "Megasse" at least is produced, it will be seen that a large reserve
of <i>Fibrous Material</i> is available, awaiting the enterprise of either
the Sugar or the Paper-manufacturer or a combination of both.</p>

<p>It is now my object to show to the <i>Two parties</i> mainly interested, the
<span class="smcap">Producer</span> and the <span class="smcap">Consumer</span>, how closely their interests are coincident,
and how <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35"></a>[p.35]</span> both would be benefited by the creation and development
of a new <span class="smcap">Industry</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Producer</span>, the Sugar-manufacturer, is, in point of fact
suffering from a similar competition to that experienced by the
Paper-manufacturer in 1861&mdash;handicapped by the <i>drawback</i> allowed on
the export of <span class="smcap">French, and Belgian, Beet-root Sugar</span>, with which
he is unable to compete, in the same manner as the Paper-maker suffered
from the introduction of <span class="smcap">French, and Belgian, Paper</span>&mdash;<i>free</i>,
while the <span class="smcap">Raw Material</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rags</span>, paid a heavy <i>export duty</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Consumer</span>, the Paper-manufacturer, is suffering from a lack
of suitable material, which the Producer is able to supply, and by so
supplying and utilizing a by-product, hitherto of little value to him,
places himself in a position to meet his competitors on equal, if not
better terms in the market.</p>

<p>It is true, that this (to him) new system of utilizing what may now be
termed a waste, or by-product, would involve the outlay of additional
capital, by the Sugar-planter or manufacturer, which he may deem
foreign to his present business, but manufacturers now-a-days make
their profits mainly by utilizing by-products.</p>

<p>A familiar instance of this may be cited in the Chemical trade; the
muriatic acid produced in the manufacture of soda, formerly run to
waste, being now employed for making bleaching powder; and, still more
recently, the by-products annaline, anthracene, ammonia, &amp;c., which
formerly created a nuisance wherever Gas-Works existed, now constitute
a large portion of their profits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page36"></a>[p.36]</span> "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," the other <i>Raw Material</i> to which I have
alluded, can hardly be called "<i>New</i>," it being well known that both
the Chinese and Japanese have from time immemorial employed "Bamboo"
for Paper-making purposes; and I have shown in the preceding "Remarks"
that attempts have more recently been made, not hitherto affording
successful commercial results.</p>

<p>It therefore would have been more correct had I, in directing attention
to "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," described it as an "<i>Old material</i>" under "<i>New
treatment</i>." Such indeed was the case with "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>," an "<i>Old
material</i>," well known, and tried ineffectually by many, previous to
my process for converting it into paper being adopted, which, however,
did not take place until it had been fully tested and approved, leading
then to its speedy employment.</p>

<p>I believe with my new system of treatment "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" will prove
to be as superior to "Esparto," in every respect as "Esparto" was found
to be superior to "Straw," the only other "<i>raw material</i>" used when it
was introduced.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" differs from "<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>," inasmuch as the
latter is produced, as it were, involuntarily, its maximum value as a
"<i>raw product</i>" being determined by its comparison with fuel; whereas
"<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" would have to be cultivated; but, as this plant
will not only grow, but flourish, in localities unsuitable for other
cultivation, and is produced with such extraordinary rapidity and
abundance, it would appear that, as a <i>Raw Product</i>, it would not cost
much, if any, more than "<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page37"></a>[p.37]</span> It is hardly my province to discuss here to which of the two
materials, "<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>" or "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>," the preference should
be given. Suffice it to say that, with "<i>the admitted fact</i>" of the
increasing scarcity of <i>Raw Material</i> for Paper-making, there is ample
scope for both. I have only to add that I shall be happy to advise with
parties who may desire to interest themselves in either question.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>As I have broadly stated that "<i>Paper-Stock</i>" can be produced from both
"<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" and "<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>," to show a good <i>Profit</i>, it
may be well to mention the present cost of "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>" reduced to
the same condition (of "<i>Paper-Stock</i>"), as it is with this <i>Material</i>
these <i>Fibres</i> would mainly have to compete, seeing that with its large
consumption and widely extended use for most classes of Paper it now rules
the Market.</p>

<p>The cost of good <i>Spanish</i> "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>" at current rates, is,
delivered into a Mill (say), 10<i>l.</i> per ton; it is generally assumed in
the Paper-trade that about 2 tons of "Esparto" are required to make 1
ton paper, the yield being from 48 to 50 per cent.</p>

<p>At 50 per cent. yield therefore we have 20<i>l.</i> per ton for "<i>Raw
Material</i>." Add to this, for chemicals, boiling, fuel, and labour,
50<i>s.</i> × 2 tons, we arrive at 25<i>l.</i> for the cost of "Esparto" in the
same condition of <i>unbleached</i> "<i>Stock</i>," sufficient for 1 ton paper.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Alfa</span>" or "<i>African</i>" Esparto does not afford so <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38"></a>[p.38]</span> good
a yield, neither will it bleach to so high a colour, nor make so good a
quality of paper as "<i>Spanish</i>"; its value therefore is proportionately
lower in the Market, say 8<i>l.</i> per ton as compared with 10<i>l.</i>: the
cost therefore of "Alfa" reduced to a similar condition of "<i>Stock</i>"
may be taken at 21<i>l.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Alfa</span>" (if carefully selected) so closely resembles
"<i>Spanish</i>" "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>," in its <i>raw condition</i>, that it
is very difficult to distinguish one from the other, and when the
two are skilfully blended, it is impossible to do so, until the
bleaching process of manufacture is reached; thus, it has happened,
that during the past two or three years many thousands of tons of
"<span class="smcap">Alfa</span>," having taken a "tour" through "<i>Spain</i>," and being
there naturalized, have found their way to England and been sold to the
unsophisticated English Paper-maker as "<i>Spanish</i>" "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>,"
thus supplementing the rapid exhaustion of the indigenous grass of that
country.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Wood</span>" "<i>Pulp</i>" as I have mentioned, is imported, both
mechanically and chemically prepared, the latter (unbleached) finding
a ready sale, at 24<i>l.</i> to 25<i>l.</i> per ton; "<span class="smcap">Straw</span>" "<i>Pulp</i>"
also (bleached) realizes 26<i>l.</i> to 27<i>l.</i> per ton, but neither of these
materials are likely to be introduced to any considerable extent.</p>

<p>"<i>Paper-Stock</i>," resulting from either "<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" or
"<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>," will show a very large margin of profit from the
figures I have quoted, thus allowing for any necessary reduction should
prices fall from increased supplies.</p>

<p>In concluding my "<i>Remarks</i>," having in the preceding <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39"></a>[p.39]</span> Pages
suggested the conversion of "<i>Raw Fibrous Substances</i>," notably,
"<span class="smcap">Bamboo</span>" and "<span class="smcap">Megasse</span>," into Fibrous "<i>Paper-Stock</i>,"
I ought perhaps distinctly to explain the difference between
"<i>Half-Stuff</i>," or "<i>Pulp</i>," and "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," and my reasons
for expressing a preference for the latter form of preparation,&mdash;a
preference warranted, I believe, both by practical, and economical
considerations.</p>

<p>Whatever "<i>Material</i>" the Paper-maker employs, be it Rags (of any
denomination) or any other "<i>Fibre</i>," or "<i>Fibrous</i>," substance, after
Boiling, he disintegrates, or comminutes it into "<i>Half-Stuff</i>,"
before, or while bleaching. This process, carried a stage farther,
converts the "<i>Half-Stuff</i>" into "<i>Pulp</i>." Herein, not less than in
the proper selection of his "<i>Raw Material</i>," lies the skill of the
Paper-maker, as, however good his "<i>Material</i>" may be, in its <i>Raw</i>
or normal condition, it may be very easily spoilt in either of the
processes of Boiling,&mdash;Bleaching,&mdash;or Pulping.</p>

<p>For example, when Bread is once toasted, thereby becoming brown (and
the purer and whiter the greater the change), whereby its chemical and
mechanical character has become altered, no power can reconvert it into
its original condition; in like manner, however good a "<i>Raw Fibrous
Material</i>" may be, if that "<i>Material</i>" be either over-boiled, or
over-pulped, no power will restore its normal character.</p>

<p>Moreover, a "<i>Fibrous</i>" substance once reduced to the condition of
"<i>Pulp</i>," it is difficult, if not impossible, even for a Microscopist,
to distinguish accurately <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40"></a>[p.40]</span> the character or quality of the
original "<i>Fibre</i>,"&mdash;its strength,&mdash;or whether it has been properly
or improperly treated, and reduced to that condition&mdash;until, perhaps
too late, when he has bleached it, and converted it, or attempted to
convert it, into a sheet of Paper.</p>

<p>With a Fibrous "<i>Paper-Stock</i>," however, these objections do not apply,
or certainly not to the same degree, as the Paper-maker could readily
examine and judge of the character and strength of the "<i>Fibre</i>"
whether it was clean and free from imperfections or adulterations&mdash;in
fact, could see what he was buying, or proposing to buy, which he could
not do with "<i>Half-Stuff</i>" or "<i>Pulp</i>."</p>

<p>So far as the Producer is concerned, his outlay for the primary "Plant"
and the mechanical appliances, the cost of the subsequent treatment,
the drying, packing, and economical carriage and freight from a Foreign
country, would in all respects be less for "<i>Paper-Stock</i>" than for
"<i>Half-Stuff</i>" or "<i>Pulp</i>."</p>

<p>Speaking from the experience of some years, during which I have conducted
the manufacture and sale of many thousand tons of "<i>Half-Stuff</i>" prepared
from "<span class="smcap">Esparto</span>" and other "<i>Raw Fibres</i>," I feel satisfied that
in introducing a <i>New Semi-prepared Material</i>, from a Foreign country,
the preference would be given by the practical Paper-maker to a "<i>Fibrous
Paper-Stock</i>."</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
